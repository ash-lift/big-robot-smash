<h2>The build process</h2>

<h3>The Kit</h3>

<p>I picked up this kit during my first visit to Scale Model World in 2022. I can't remember why I picked the kit in the end. I tend to agonise over what to buy. I think I was pursuaded to hurry up and pick something by my Dad who was likely flagging after being dragged around each trader at least 3 times.</p>

<p>Anyway, I ended up with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scalemates.com/kits/meng-model-ts-052-sdkfz-171-panther-ausfg-early-ausfg-with-air-defence-armor--1376572">1:35 Panther Ausf.G by Meng</a>, and it was a slow build for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I kept becoming distracted by other models in my stash.</li>
  <li>Daunting build with lots of choices and decisions.</li>
  <li>Inner struggle on whether to attempt zimmerit or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>After chickening out on my first attempt at zimmerit, the build eventually came together. Instead of zimmerit, I decided to challenge myself by creating a three-color camouflage scheme. My previous tanks had been either German Grey or Olive Green.</p>

<p>The kit was fine for the most part. Quite a bit of photoetch; the cables it came with were a bit rubbish, and the tracks were a pain I quickly gave up on.</p>

<p>I ended up ditching the tow cable and tracks. I picked up an Eureka XXL copper cable which was fantastic and some MasterClub tracks. I was really happy with the new cable; it could be bent into shape and it would stay that way. I would definitely use one again.</p>

<p>The photoetch that came with the kit worked well. There wasn't anything too fiddly or complex. After assembly, I tweaked the cast textures and weld beads in the usual way and was ready for painting.</p>

<h2>The Painting</h2>

<h3>Priming</h3>

<p>After issues with the Sherman's metal barrel and looking at the Panther's metal sch√ºrzen I opted to prime the metal parts with VMS Metal Primer. Nothing revolutionary for the rest, the usual prime in black using Mr Surfacer.</p>

<h3>Camouflage</h3>

<p>I did decide to practice some camouflage on a small <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scalemates.com/kits/vespid-models-vs720010-sdkfz-173-jagdpanther-g1--1380531">1:72 scale Jagdpanther from Vespid</a> and I'm glad I did. During my practice run I tried using some masking putty, while the putty performed well I wasn't really happy with the finish and ended up going back over with no masking and feathering the edges a bit.</p>

<p>Back onto the Panther. I put down a solid coat of Dunkelgelb from AK Real colours and using a scheme from the manual as a basis I slowly laid down the first part of the pattern in Olivgrun (again AK real colours).</p>

<p>Sticking with AK I finished the pattern with some Rotbraun and a quick tidy with the previous two colours.</p>

<p>Next, one of my favorite parts: detail painting and a pin wash. The tools and accessories were painted with various acrylics and the metallic parts had some graphite powder added to help give them a subtle shine/highlight.</p>

<p>Oils are now my go to for washes. In this case an dark brown pin wash was added to help accentuate the small details (panels, welds, rivets and bolts).</p>

<p>Paint chips were applied with a sponge for the first pass with a lighter dark yellow (seems odd to say that!) and then detailed with a dark grey for deeper chips using a brush. I've gone a bit light touch with the chips, I'm always a bit worried about over doing it.</p>

<p>Finally some mud effects were added. I used the same pigments and process as I did for the <a href="/posts/tamiya-easy-eight/">Sherman</a>.</p>
