<p>This was my third trip to Telford for Scale Model World and first time attending with a club. It was also the first time I did both days instead of just Saturday, while exhausting (mainly the driving) it was thoroughly enjoyable!</p>

<p>Being there both days with a club meant I approached my visit very differently compared to previous years. For one I opted not to look around other club displayed until the Sunday. This was mainly because my Dad was coming along on the Sunday I wanted to save that for him, it had the added benefit of being a bit quieter and more relaxed.</p>

<p>Saving club displays for Sunday meant Saturday could be focused on traders! That didn't really go quite to plan though, more on that later...</p>

<p>Attending with my local club was a blast and I'm already looking forward to next year's show with the club. I didn't quite get me D.A.K diorama finished, but did bring along the tanks and figures that were just about finished the night before.</p>

<h2>Amazing things I saw</h2>

<p>Here is a fraction of the fantastic things I saw on the Sunday</p>

<h2>What I missed</h2>

<p>Despite being there both days I completley missed the competition. I kept saying to myself I'll go look but found a different distraction each time. I think because it was outside of the three main halls it just kept slipping my mind. I'll definitely prioritise it next year.</p>

<h2>What did I pick up?</h2>

<p>Arguably the most important question. Those who know me best, know I find it very difficult buying things for myself. I tend to want something, but quickly talk myself into actuyally getting it. It took the full two days to talk myself out and then back in to getting my big buy, grabbing it with only 20 mins to go! In the end I think I was inspired by the amount the rest of the club were picking up.</p>

<p>Next year I'll need a firm plan and a list with some room for impulse purchases. Anyway this was my haul:</p>

<h3>Supplies</h3>

<p>Knew I needed some general supplies, while you surrounded by thinners and paints with no postage costs you should make the most. Picked up some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mrpaint.sk/">MRP paints</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.premiumhobbies.co.uk/">Premium Hobbies</a> for the B24 I'm working on. I'm really enjoying MRP paint. I picked one up for my Panzer IV after being very dissatisfied with an AK real colour for Tropen camo. I love the fact it is prethinned so I can just get going with it, it goes down great and they seem to do a great range of WWII colours. Not as cost effective as others, but I love the convenience.</p>

<h3>Matilda II (Tamiya)</h3>

<p>Wanted to do some British armour for a while now. Was thinking of doing a Firefly, but I think I'll wait to get a Sherman itch. I really like the dazzle like scheme and after working on my D.A.K build I'm really feeling the desert. Fruimodel was at the show so I also picked up some tracks to go with it. An indulgence, I just really like metal tracks though!</p>

<h3>The Bloody Hundredth B17 (Eduard)</h3>

<p>A kit I've wanted for a while. Before the show I said to myself I wasn't going to get it. I had got Airfix's B24 for my birthday to scratch the bomber itch. I saw some really great B17 builds though, and while I had completley ruled out the 1/32 HK version, 1/48 was still on the cards. It took all weekend of internal strife and conflict, but I pulled the trigger and got it. Now I just need to finish the B24 and not burn out so I can start it.</p>

<h2>Here is to next year!</h2>

<p>Part of me wants to challenge myself further and put something into the competition, the other part feels like I'm not ready. We shall see.</p>

<p>One thing is certain â€“ I'll be going with the club again and I can't wait!</p>
