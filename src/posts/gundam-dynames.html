<h2>The Kit</h2>
<p>This is Bandai's MasterGrade Gundam Dynames in 1/100 scale. I remember, at the time, there was quite a bit of hype for this kit. I bought into that hype and had this kit on pre-order straight away. I was not disappointed!</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>
<p>It was a pleasure to build, the engineering and fit was perfect, it really came together no problem. I'm always amazed how these Bandai kits can hold together without need for glue (mostly!).</p>

<p>I added some small pieces of photoetch to the shields, I just thought it would benefit from some extra details here.</p>

<h2>The Painting</h2>

<p>Nothing fancy for painting here. I used Ammo Acrylics colors as it was a time when I had limited ventilation for airbrushing. I spent a while testing different greens, I had recently got burned by a green I used for a HG Leo kit that was way too dark. They went down pretty well, though I will always prefer more robust options, especially for anything with moving parts or articulation.</p>

<h2>Adding a Stand</h2>
<p>While the kit was built and painted back in 2019, I did revisit it as I wanted to do something about displaying it. All my other Gundams are pretty much just stood in a standard standing pose. For this, I wanted to do something a little more dynamic.</p>
<p>The model has great articulation, and to take advantage of that, I decided to make a simple stand. I bought a small wooden box from Hobbycraft, cut it at an angle, added some weight (a big rock!), and sealed it up. Then I added a brass rod to attach the Mobile Suit to and quickly painted it to somewhat resemble a ship or space station panel.</p>
