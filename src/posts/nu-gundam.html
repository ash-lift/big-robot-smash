<h2>The Kit</h2>

<p>I bought this kit way back in 2015. I was in Japan for the first time and was a bit overzealous in my shopping when just a few days in I picked up this and the MG Sazabi Ver Ka without thinking:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How am I going to travel around Japan with these?</li>
  <li>How am I going to get these home?</li>
</ol>
<p>I squashed one giant box in my luggage and resigned myself to travelling with the other in a carrier bag.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>I took a completely different approach to this then my normal builds and in hindsight it was a mistake I will never repeat. For this I... skipped the build. That is right, I snipped all the parts, organised them by colour and moved onto the painting.</p>

<p>I think my reasoning at the time was to do with painting the inner frame and I didn't want to get to a point of being burnt out at the disassembly.</p>

<h2>The Painting</h2>

<p>I broke up the painting into 4 sections:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Legs and weapons</li>
  <li>Torso</li>
  <li>Arms</li>
  <li>Head and fin funnels</li>
</ol>

<p>The innerframe parts were mainly painted with Tamiya X-10 (gun metal). I preshaded all the white and offwhite armour as a first and was happy with how it turned out.</p>

<p>In the end there was a large gap between steps 1 and 2. In fact, a gap large enough to travel to Japan a couple more times, start and finish the MG Dynames and move house!</p>

<p>More recently I returned to the kit and was happy to complete it. I've improved my painting during the gap and to me it is noticeable, the finish on the shoulders is much nicer than the legs.</p>
