<p>So at this point, I'm becoming a bit obsessed with armored models. Maybe I'm growing fatigued with the articulation-heavy mobile suits I've been putting together for years, or perhaps it's because I've become enthralled and inspired by watching <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@NightShiftScaleModels">NightShift's videos</a>. Probably both.</p>
<p>The Tiger I has a very iconic silhouette, and the tank carries a visual weight to it. It is intimidating and menacing, and the fact that Hobbycraft has a Tamiya 1:35 scale version in stock is what drew me to dip my toe into the water.</p>

<h2>The Assembly</h2>

<p>Overall, it was a simple and fun build. I picked up some extra photoetch for some of the engine grills and opted to use some Friulmodel metal tracks, as I don't trust the weird rubbery ones it comes with. I also added some extra and updated the existing weld beads with some epoxy putty.</p>
<p>The wheels were a little fiddly as the kit didn't have any polycaps and the fit was a bit loose, but that's really my only complaint.</p>

<h2>Painting and Weathering</h2>

<p>This was way more fun than I expected! Up until this point, I've not ventured into weathering my models. All the Gunpla I worked on really would have suited some light chipping, but I was very wary to try after spending so long on the assembly and paint job.</p>
<p>To help, I decided to follow a guide, and so I picked up a book by Ammo by Mig Jimenez and followed the steps for a winter scheme. After applying a basecoat of <strong>Dunkelgrau</strong>, I was ready to start.</p>
<p>First step was some chipping medium and a coat of Matt White. I then had a fun time with a damp paintbrush slowly chipping away some of the whitewash. I tried to mainly keep to raised areas, but I could have focused on some areas that tank crw would have walked on or interacted with a bit more. Something learned for next time!</p>

</ul>
<p>I applied a few washes and filters to help harmonize the whitewash and basecoat a little before moving onto my favorite part: oil streaks and mud.</p>
<p>Flicking mud and getting messy was fun. The fact that the build wasn't long and the basecoat and chipping was done in less than a day gave me a freedom that I've not felt with Gunpla.</p>

<h2>I'm sold</h2>
<p>I have a favorite part on this tank. It's not the big gun or the hulking tracks, nor is it the spinning turret with the commander poking out. It's one small oil streak to the rear. I don't know why it's this, but there's something really satisfying about that little streak. It adds a tiny bit of warmth to the tone, maybe? Perhaps it's the shape and feathering of the edge. Regardless, that streak has sold me on armor models.</p>
