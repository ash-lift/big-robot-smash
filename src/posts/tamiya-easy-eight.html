<p>After completing the Tiger I, I thought it would be a good idea to have a go at some Allied armour next. Some sort of Sherman felt like the obvious choice and I had recently watched the movie <em>Fury</em> so why not an 'Easy Eight'?</p>
<p>Here I document the build process from start to finish. You can <a href="#final_images">skip this</a> to view the final images if you want.</p>

<h2>The build process</h2>
<h3>The kit</h3>
<p>The kit was the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scalemates.com/kits/tamiya-35346-m4a3e8-sherman-easy-eight--959297">1:35 Tamiya from 2015</a> with some Fruimodel metal tracks and a Aber metal gun barrel.</p>
<p>Like the Tiger the kit went together no problem. I made some light modifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The grab handles on hatches were improved with wire.</li>
  <li>Milliput was used to add some weld beads around some areas.</li>
  <li>The turret was textured with some plastic cement and Mr Surfacer putty.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>I was really happy with the metal tracks, like last time, they went together no problem and give the tank some nice weight and easily burnished.</p>
<p>The kit was primed with Black Mr Surfacer primer through my airbrush and painted with Tamiya XF-62 Olive Drab. I used a little bit of Dark Yellow to lighten some of the areas.</p>

  <figcaption>The kit allowed me to keep the upper and lower hull seperate to make painting easier.</figcaption>

<p>Stock decals were added sealed and a bit of light chipping was hand-painted onto edges and raised areas.</p>

<p>Finally a dark brown oil wash was added, the model varnished and I was ready to add the mud effects.</p>
<h3>Mud, mud, glorious mud</h3>
<p>This time for mud I gave VMS products a try. Using their pigments, weathering carrier, binders and a hairdryer I set to work.</p>

<p>I'm broadly happy with the outcome, though at the time I was not, hence the lack of photos. It was a slow process as I found myself adding a lot and then removing a lot, slowly building up layers until I was either, happy or just fed up, I can't remember which!</p>
<h3>Pushing myself</h3>
<h4>Part one: Stowage</h4>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/tamiya-sherman-easy-eight/stowage-planning.png" alt="">
</figure>
<p>For this build I wanted to push myself a bit more and part one of that is by adding stowage. I really like seeing armour ladened with stowage and really wanted to load this thing up.</p>
<p>I'm not completely happy with the result here, I like the resin parts but I feel like the arrangement and integration could be improved. I was perhaps a bit too late in adding the stowage which caused me to be hesitant in placing items for fear of ruining the paint job on the model.</p>
<p>Next time I'll be intergrating the stowage prior to the priming so that it can be painted and weathered at the same time.</p>
<h4>Part two: A base</h4>
<p>My Tiger is still currently resting on a cutoff from an old IKEA desk. To save the Sherman from the same fate I thought about making some sort of base.</p>
<p>I had been watching some videos by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@135scaledioramabuilds9">@135scaledioramabuilds9</a> on YouTube and was fascinated by some of the builds that use plaster cast bricks. I bought a couple of moulds, one for cobbles and another for curbs and set off casting.</p>
<p>The casting process was long and the ad-hoc method I was using to prevent airbubbles in the moulds was not completely successful. Without a vibrating plate I took to balancing the moulds on my aircompressor while it was running to help rattle out any bubbles.</p>
<p>The process was fraught with danger and a couple of facedown moulds on my shed floor was inevitable.</p>
<ul class="image_grid image_grid--2col">

  <li><img src="/assets/images/tamiya-sherman-easy-eight/cobbles-2.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>After deciding on a very simple layout for the cobbles I got to work laying them. Next time I do something similar I'll probably consider the follwing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lower the gutter bricks a little bit.</li>
  <li>Add a drain for some more visual interest.</li>
  <li>Add some broken cobbles or even partially 'blow up' part of the street.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now onto the painting. Oh boy was this a few nights of tediously painting different shades greys of grey, browns and pinks. Though I think totally worth it in the end. I'm really happy with the distribution of the colours.</p>

</ul>
<p>Grouting the road was straightforward enough, I collected some soil from my garden, dried it off and sieved it a few times. Then with a large soft brush gentle encouraged it into the gaps before fixing with a VMS ballast freeze.</p>

<p>Finally I used some acrylic washes through paranoia that anything agressive might seep through and eat a hole in the foam beneath.</p>
<h3>Figures</h3>

<p>Figures were added to the scene. These are a tank crew from Alpine miniatures and were painted alongside the tank. These were then pinned to the base and seated in the turret.</p>
