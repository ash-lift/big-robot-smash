<p>This is the Master Grade version 3.0. It was an enjoyable enough build, though I did prefer the One Year Version as it feels more sturdy. The 3.0 does have some pieces that tend to pop off while posing. This was less of a problem after painting.</p>

<p>It has great articulation and weight balance allowing for interesting options for posing, not that I have taken any advantage of that.</p>

<p>Painted with Tamiya paints using my Iwata High Performance Plus.</p>
