<h2>Hi! My name is Ash.</h2>
<p>I'm a Designer and Front-End Developer at <a target="_blank" href="https://studiolift.com">Lift</a>.</p>
<p>In my downtime, you can usually find me to right of a fairway after slicing my drive, slurping up delicious bowls of ramen, or working on a scale model.</p> 
<p>This blog is all about diving into the fascinating world of scale models, but don't be surprised if I veer off course occasionally to share tidbits about my other passions and interests too. </p>
<p>So, grab a seat, relax, and let's embark on this journey together as we explore the art of model-making and whatever else catches our fancy along the way!</p>
